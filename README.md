Stylized conversation content driven by Aesop Story Engine.

A single chat component is one piece of conversation: one chat bubble. Using a single chat bubble as the building block, any number of chat bubble components can comprise the end result. Short or long, it's completely up to you, the content creator.

##Options

Using the component's built-in options, the chat colors can vary on a post-by-post basis. Multiple conversations in a single post can have varied colors, due to the modular nature of the components.

**Appearance** defines the style of chat bubble. There is a default style, but it's not very interesting. There are options to imitate the appearance of chat styles used by Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, and iOS Messaging.

**Width** defines the maximum width of the chat bubble. It will never exceed this value, but it can be shorter, if there is not enough text to fill a single line. Please note that the "px" suffix is already included, so all this field requires is a number.

**Background Color** defines the background color <em>behind</em> the chat bubble. It's always the full width of the screen.

**Chat Color** defines the background color of the chat bubble itself. The bubble arrow also takes on this color.

**Text Color** defines the text color in the chat bubble.

**Direction** defines where the chat bubble, its arrow, and avatar (optional) come from: left or right.

**Content** defines the text inside the chat bubble. Enter as much or as little as you want!

**Avatar** defines the picture associated with the chat bubble. This is optional.

**Avatar Style** defines the shape of the avatar. By default, it's just a square image. It can be changed to rounded corners (I call this a "squircle") or a circle.
